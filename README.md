# Why

Adv360 is a great key board, until you try to customize it and to reflash the firmware. From my past experiences, upstream changes to the zmk firmware can cause undesired behavior of the keyboard, and some of those are hard to be reproduced.

Due to this reason, I decided to open this repository to track my own configuration together with their associated zmk version. And they are maintained with git submodules.

# Disclaimer

Since there could be minor differences between hardwares, I cannot guarantee that this will work for every Adv360. Use this repo at your own risk.
